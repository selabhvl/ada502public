## Sprint 1 Planning

Below you will find some hints on how to approach the planning for sprint 1 and the associated presentation:

For the work that you will be doing on engineering of the FireGuard cloud-service software product we will deliberately not specify what you are supposed to do in each sprint. The reason for this is that a main aim of the work is that you use the Scrum method to plan the engineering of the software product and get experince with using it. 

Some key aspects that you may consider in the planning of sprin1 1 would be:

- select a tool that can be use for adminidtration of your product backlog items (PBIs)
- create a github repository for manageing your code, make sure that all group member have access to the repository
- create an initial backlog based on the discussions and outcomes of the lectures on scenarious, user stories, features and software architecture
- the backlog may contain all sorts of items that comes to your mind in terms of what needs to be done to complete the engineering of the software product, including components/user stories/features that needs to be implemented, and software engineering tools that needs to be put in place to support the development 
- create a diagram representing your current understanding of the overall software architecture
- what components of the Fire Risk Computation Model implementation (covered in the lectures) may be used, possibly in a refactored form as a starting point for the FireGuard product. These may be good candidates for backlog items and possibly also for sprin1 1 backlog items
- a sprint backlog for sprint 1 containing a selection of the PBIs that you plan to work on and complete in sprint 1

When doing the planning, you should also look in the current teaching plan for ADA502 in terms of when you will learn about the various software technologies needed in the engineering of the software product. 

As we have not yet covered many software technologies in the course, then it may be a good idea to start with sprint 1 focussing on getting familier with the components and interfaces of the implementation of the fire risk computation model, and refactoring the relevants parts in according with your initial FireGuard software architecture. Examples may be to factor out the data harvesting, and adapt the computation such that it takes weather data as input instead of fecthing it from the weather data sources (MET) for every computation. This may also entail refactoring and possibly adding additional tests such that you have some automated tests to execute when making changes to the implementation.
